Simple script to scrape a facebook post's comments and randomly select one user.

The use of this script is for a buddy and his friend to make and sell fishing lures via facebook. They make so few that they have to raffle off the lures one at a time. Hundreds of users comment that they want in on the raffle. The most simple solution I came up with was to simply copy/paste all of the comments and save them in a file. From there, run the file through my script and walla, we have a winner!
